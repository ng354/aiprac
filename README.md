## Local Installation
Since our project is a web application, you will need to set up a local webserver on your computer. If you don't already have a local sever installed, we recommend installing either XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or MAMP (https://www.mamp.info/en/) for your operating system.

Both XAMPP and MAMP have very easy and straightforward installers. Follow their respective instructions to install the software. Once it is installed, run the program. While it should already be on by default, you'll want to double check that the APACHE (or nginx) service is running -- this is your webserver!

You can verify that your webserver is running by pointing your browser to ``localhost`` and seeing the default webserver page load up. Next, you'll want to open up your file explorer and open up your Document Root directory (the folder where the contents of ``localhost`` are loaded from).

By default, XAMPP's Document Root on Windows is located in
```
c:xampp/htdoc
```

Open up the folder and replace all of the files there with the demo files for our project.

You can verify that our demo site is working by simply refreshing your browser on the ``localhost`` url.
Have fun!
